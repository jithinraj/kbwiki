# Kilobyte Wiki

This is a minimal wiki software that tries to keep it's output measured in 10s of kilobytes, rather than in megabytes. 

You'll need Nim 1.0 installed to run this software, then you'll need to run

`nimble install jester`

and then you can build and run it with 

`nim c -r kbwiki.nim`
